The test is meant to check the cadidate coding style by doing a sinple application with login and create account page with an users list.

It must be done with **React** and **Typescript** or Flow.

*In my opinion it would also be a **diferential** to use **Redux** for state management, **Cypress** for testing and some **CI/CD** principles, **even though those things may not be evaluated**.*
